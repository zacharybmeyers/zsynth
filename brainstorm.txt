synth notes are playable via UI

recordAudio function can record a single note and download the file as 
.webm to Downloads (cannot specify a different location, browser specific)

use ffmpeg to convert file from .webm to .mp3 (or .wav) and store in DB
    -how to make this happen automatically?

zsynth service queries the DB and returns the specified file
